Python implementation of Bayesian Topic Models

Main contributor: JinYeong Bak (jy.bak@kaist.ac.kr)

We implement several topic models with various inference methods (Gibbs sampling, Variational Inference, Distributed, Online, etc).

We also upload the technical reports that how to inferece the models. It will be helpful to understand our implementation and topic model itself.

PS

Java implementation of Bayesian Topic Models (https://github.com/NoSyu/Topic_Models) was sold to the company, so we do not open it as public.
Instead, we implement Bayesian Topic Models by Python for avoiding license issues.
